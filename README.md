# Ludum_Dare_51
  In my IB Computer Science class, I have to do an internal assessment. So, in leu of that fact, I've decided to sorta participate in Ludum Dare 51. But what does "sorta" mean? It means that I may or may not totally finish my game before the submission deadline. This is beacuse I am planning on programming something with a framework that I have no experience using, and a coding language I have not entirely mastered. So this is a learning experience more than anything.

On the project specifically, I've decided to program the game using Windows standard Win32 API and the GDI(Graphical Device Interface) platform in Visual Studio using C. I thought this would be the best option to program my game in, because it gives me experience with both the C language and the internal Windows API framework. which is based on the fact that the Windows operating system is still one of the most used desktop enviornment in the world. So, when or if I decide to move on to future projects using the windows application framework, it will not be as daunting of a task.

What I have decided to do:

_______________________________________
Yea...So, it turns out that I just didn't dedicate enough time to this, so I got nothing done. This was a all out failure... whatever though. I'll still keep at this project for those who want to see it when it's finished. This was mostly a learning experience for me, so there is nothing to really fret from this Thank you, if anyone, looked at this during LD51.

In the end, Have a nice day!
