Game idea:
name: The Tick of Time
design:
It is will be a clock, that every ten seconds you have to push the button for, but if you do not push the button an explosion happens. Also the clock keeps getting faster.
This could keep going to multiple stages and such, but that will be kinda cumbersome. Focus on the main thing.

APPLICATION:
-In terms of the application itself, I do not want to have to mess a lot with text wrap and formating, so the game will open in window borderless from the start.

Scenes needed:
(1)Main menu
	(-)Settings
	(-)Play Button
	(-)Exit Button
(2)The main game scene
	(-)The clock can be an image or it's own object depending on if it's gonna get animation.(The clock is going to be a minute stop watch)
	(-)The ticker has to be it's own object with a rotation set to it for it's tick.
	(-)The button will be it's own object with animation.
	(-)If there are affects based on actions those will also be included.
(3)The fail scene
	(-)Restart Button
	(-)Main Menu Button
	(-)Exit Button
(4)The Victory scene
	(-)Play Again Button
	(-)Main Menu Button
	(-)Exit Button

Scene design:
Main menu - > game -> victory/fail -> Main Menu/Game(Make sure to delete all resources from a previous scene before moving onto a new scene)
